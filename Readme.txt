The descriptions of the files included is as follows:

• Implementation Summary.pdf - A summary of the design and the implementation reports

• FIFO_shift_reg_beh.v - The Verilog description of the FIFO Shift Register

• FIFO_shift_reg_beh_tb.v - Test bench for testing the device

• constraints.xdc - Timing constraints for the synthesis

• Simulation Results.wcfg - Waveforms generated after the simulation (can be opened in Vivado)



This is my very first program in Verilog, and hence I haven't touched on the finer aspects of the design such as timing and power consumption. Please tweak the design according to your requirements, and avoid using it as it is.
